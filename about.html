            <p>
              When I was about 10, my favorite thing to “play” was Whitney’s Hair Salon in my mom’s bathroom.
              Styling hair always came naturally to me, and I’ve always been pretty good at it! I was constantly
              braiding and styling all my friends’ and sisters’ hair on the weekends or trying out new styles on my own hair.
            </p>

            <p>
              After two quick semesters in college, I realized a traditional education wasn’t for me. I decided to try
              cosmetology school and I loved it! I graduated and started working at a busy salon in College Station,
              learning skills and gaining business knowledge from an awesome business owner, great salon manager, and skilled co-workers.
              I became a manager after two years and helped open a new location.
            </p>

            <p>
              After managing that salon for seven years, I felt ready to open one of my own. I always knew owning a business was in my future.
            </p>

            <p>
              After 10 years of hard work, that dream finally came true. I opened Haircuts at Whitney’s in 2014 with two goals.
              First, I wanted a budget-friendly place where walk-in customers could get a great cut. Second, I wanted a place where talented
              stylists could make a good income and have the freedom to set their own schedule.
            </p>

            <p>
              My salon has been open for over 10 years now, and it couldn’t have happened without our customers! I am so grateful for each and
              every customer and their support throughout the years. All of us at Haircuts at Whitney’s look forward to taking care of you for years to come.
            </p>
